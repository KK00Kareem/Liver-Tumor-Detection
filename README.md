# Liver-Tumor-Detection
Liver Tumor Detection from MRI Scans (.nii) Using U-Net and SVM This project presents an end-to-end pipeline for automated liver tumor detection using MRI scans in NIfTI (.nii) format. It leverages both machine learning (SVM) and deep learning (U-Net) techniques, supported by detailed voxel-level preprocessing and analysis.
